The topic of the research is: "The impact of confidence on the US housing bubble‚Äù. 

In the research Vector autoregressive model (VAR) is used to check how the confidence, other macroeconomic variables and their 
lags influenced Housing Price Index (HPI) before and during the crisis 2008. 

Scope for replicating the initial research (in R) :

  1.  Inverse Roots of AR Characteristic Polynomial [Semenov],

  2.  LR test statistic, the Final prediction error, Akaike and Hannan-Quinn information criterion [Semenov],

  3.  Correlation between variables in the model [Ahmed],

  4.  VAR model [Ahmed],

  5.  Granger causality test [Singh],

  6.  Impulse responses [Singh],

Scope for improving the initial research:

  1.  More data [Semenov],
  
  2.  Cointegration between variables in the model [Ahmed],
  
  4.  Forecast error variance decomposition [Singh].
